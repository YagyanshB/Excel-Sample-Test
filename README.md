# Excel-Sample-Test
A sample Excel test to check your proficiency

Scale the Part II marks in the attached spreadsheet according to the following rules:

· The median mark of each Part II exam should be the same as the median the students taking that exam achieved overall in Part I.

· A simple shift in marks (i.e. all students get plus or minus N marks) except in the following cases

i. The maximum mark possible is 100. Any scaling taking the marks above this would be moved back to 100.

ii. The minimum mark is 0. Any scaling taking the mark below this would be moved back to 0.

iii. No student can be failed as a result of scaling. i.e. if a raw score was greater than the failure mark of 40, then the lowest the student can score is 40.

The scaled marks should go in columns G to I. Not all students took all the exams in Part II. If a student did not take an exam, the entry is blank in the column.
